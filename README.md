Mending Relationships?   
Topic:  
My topic is whether the hurt done in a relationship can be repaired by literal language. 

Background:  
The inspiration comes from a personal experience and some current social phenomena.  
In my view, there is no way that past hurts in a relationship can be repaired by some words later on. The act of mending is a true disclosure of the hurt, and it more likes a secondary injury.

About Work:  
It is an interactive installation.  
Participants write down some memorable words they have heard in a relationship on the place of the crack or hurt that they want to mend on this installation. And then the machine starts to moving and sewing the “words” over the crack.  
With more and more words sewing on it, the overlapping words and sewing threads reach a certain thickness. Participants can observe that no more words can be mended. This may be the result.  
The process of everyone's interactive participation has made this work. In the end it is also like an artwork in itself, expressing a point of view and containing many stories.

Initial ideas for the Structure:  
For the structure of the mending machine, I would like to use a sewing machine or a stapler. One that has more of a sewing feel to it. And with the staples looking and sounding more like a hurt.
